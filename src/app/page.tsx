      <p>
        Web developer with a passion for creating apps that make you smile. I
        implement brilliant code for brilliant solutions. I originally worked on
        an array of creative projects in 3D fabrication, from custom modular
        electronic signs, to mechanical display models, boutique custom
        electronic housings + more and now I&apos;ve turned my sights to code.
        Using Javascript, React, and TypeScript (so far) to build apps that
        entertain. When I work I bring an optimistic and chipper attitude with a
        hint of my cheeky nature to ease the tension.
